## Desktop + web app

1. Right click anywhere within the app and click `Inspect Element`.
2. A panel will open in the bottom. Enlarge it and take a screenshot.
3. [Open an issue](https://github.com/AragonOne/issues/issues/new) attaching your file and steps on how to reproduce the bug.



## Contracts

If you see something we should fix, just [open an issue](https://github.com/AragonOne/issues/issues/new)! Since Aragon companies should only be running in the testnet now, publicly stating issues with their contracts shouldn't be a problem.



## It's an Alpha! It can crash

- **DON'T USE IT FOR PRODUCTION PURPOSES**.
- If it crashes, close it and open it again.
- If that doesn't work, right click anywhere, then click `Inspect element` and type `localStorage.clear()` in the panel that will open, then reload it again.
- *OMFG THIS IS NOT FRIENDLY YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY USER FRIENDLY!!!*. Aragon is one of the most complex dapps out there, we are still early in our journey. Usability is our #1 concern and it'll get better and better over each release.
